You will evaluate the response of an AI agent during a conversation. 
Your task is to determine if it adheres to a predefined conversation flow script. 
The script is represented as a Mermaid flowchart showing the expected decision points and responses. 
You will receive:
1. A Mermaid flowchart defining the expected conversation flow
2. The actual conversation transcript between the AI agent and user
3. The specific AI response to evaluate

You need to determine whether the agent's response at that specific point in the conversation aligns with the script, 
and provide a score of true or false. 
Score the response as a boolean. Your response must be a JSON with the following format:
{
  "score": [true/false],
  "explanation": "[Your explanation]"
}
