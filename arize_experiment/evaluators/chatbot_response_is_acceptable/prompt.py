- 0.00: Completely irrelevant or ignores the user's intent.

Accuracy (0-1): Is the information factually correct, consistent with the script/knowledge base, and free from misleading claims?
- 1.00: Completely accurate, well-supported by facts.
- 0.50: Mostly accurate but contains minor inconsistencies.
